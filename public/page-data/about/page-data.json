Certain she would pursue floral design; Susanne attended Humber College for Retail Floral Culture right out of high school and quickly became the owner of her own small shop called Green Leaves & Petals. The switch from storefront retail to a studio was made so that Susanne could execute her clients’ visions on a larger scale.</p><p>Just like the name implies, Wildflowers & Co finds inspiration in the beauty of resilient florals and plants that thrive in nature. Relying on locally sourced flowers, Wildflowers & Co prides itself on seasonal arrangements and sustainable flowers.</p><p>Well-connected in the event space, Susanne loves helping clients and couples bring their concepts to life. Working with established wholesaler contacts, Susanne chooses to work with people who are as passionate about their flowers as she is.</p><p>A true collaborator, she’s always happy to consult with clients in-studio to execute their vision and pick out flower samples.
